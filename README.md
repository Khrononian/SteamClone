# SteamClone

The biggest challenge of this project was getting Firebase and the Steam API to correctly show all of the given data. Some games were not available and then I would have to find a workaround to prevent bugs and unprecedented issues. In this project I also learned the process of using Context, building a signup/login feature, and a commenting system with the help of Firebase.
